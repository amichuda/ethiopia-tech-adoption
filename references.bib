               Ethiopia following the major drought and famine that occurred in
               1984. More than 9 million smallholder households, more than for
               any other crop in the country, grow maize in Ethiopia at
               present. Ethiopia has doubled its maize productivity and
               production in less than two decades. The yield, currently
               estimated at >3 metric tons/ha, is the second highest in
               Sub-Saharan Africa, after South Africa; yield gains for Ethiopia
               grew at an annual rate of 68 kg/ha between 1990 and 2013, only
               second to South Africa and greater than Mexico, China, or India.
               The maize area covered by improved varieties in Ethiopia grew
               from 14 \% in 2004 to 40 \% in 2013, and the application rate of
               mineral fertilizers from 16 to 34 kg/ha during the same period.
               Ethiopia's extension worker to farmer ratio is 1:476, compared
               to 1:1000 for Kenya, 1:1603 for Malawi and 1:2500 for Tanzania.
               Increased use of improved maize varieties and mineral
               fertilizers, coupled with increased extension services and the
               absence of devastating droughts are the key factors promoting
               the accelerated growth in maize productivity in Ethiopia.
               Ethiopia took a homegrown solutions approach to the research and
               development of its maize and other commodities. The lesson from
               Ethiopia's experience with maize is that sustained investment in
               agricultural research and development and policy support by the
               national government are crucial for continued growth of

  author   = "Wale, Edilegnaw",
  abstract = "Before making any recommendation for the use of improved seeds,
              policy makers have to ensure that the improved seeds are superior
              to the local ones. To generate information on the financial
              viability of improved seeds, this paper computes the gross margin
              that farmers lose when they fail to use these inputs. Using the
              switching regression method, it then examines the contextual
              factors that affect the income foregone if farmers fail to use
              improved seeds.The study is based on the fifth round of the
              Ethiopian rural household survey data taking wheat as a case. The
              estimated foregone gross margin ranges from 277 to 886 Birr per
              hectare and the total gross margin foregone at the national level
              ranges from 295 million to 946 million Birr per year. On the
              whole, the results suggest that, even though failure to use
              improved seeds involves foregoing financial benefits, it varies
              across farmers and farming systems. Not all farmers forego equal
              financial benefits.The regression results show that the gross
              margin foregone increases with labour use, fertilizer use,
              farmers' experience with the extension package, wheat marketing,
              rainfall suitability, and wheat price index. On the contrary, it
              decreases with plot quality, education, input price index, oxen
              ownership, and chemical use. The results imply that improved
              seeds will have better income generating capacity when
              accompanied by other complementary services. Agricultural
              extension policy should establish targeting principles based on
              the comparative advantage of the respective seeds. On the whole,
              blanket recommendation of improved seeds for all farmers and

  abstract  = "In recent years, maize has gained prominence as an important
               staple crop in Ethiopia second only to teff in terms of acreage.
               Most of this is grown by semi-subsistence farm households whose
               livelihoods are tied to crop production and some livestock
               keeping. Therefore, an important policy question concerns the
               impact that the reported maize revolution has had on household
               food security. This paper answers that question by examining the
               empirical regularities that explain the adoption of improved
               maize varieties (IMVs) and how this has impacted household food
               security in a sample of 2327 maize producing households in 39
               districts of Ethiopia. An endogenous switching regression model
               supported by the dose-response continuous treatment effect
               method was used to empirically assess the impact of IMV adoption
               on per capita food consumption expenditure and perceived
               household food security status. Results show that IMV adoption
               has a robust and positive impact on per capita food consumption
               and also significantly increases the probability of a
               smallholder being in food surplus. The advances in the adoption
               of improved maize has thus contributed significantly to the food
               security of maize producing smallholders, confirming the role of
               crop improvement in contributing to food security of agrarian
